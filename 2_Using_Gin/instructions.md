Ok, you've passed the first test! We would like to see you take this service
to the next level before we reveal your assignment.

Gin is a very common Golang web framework. We would like to see you implement that here.

# Your assignment (should you choose to accept it)

Initialize a new go mod for your project and install the [gin webframework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) dependency. (hint: check their repo README for install instructions if you're unsure)

Refactor your existing code to use Gin rather than standard lib for the router, handlers, and responses.

Try using gin.H instead of declaring a status struct.
