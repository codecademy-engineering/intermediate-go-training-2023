# Your assignment (should you choose to accept it)

Initialize a new go mod for your project and install the [gin webframework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) dependency. (hint: check their repo README for install instructions if you're unsure)

Refactor your existing code to use Gin rather than standard lib for the router, handlers, and responses.
