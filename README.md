# Structure

Lessons are chronologically ordered in the numbered dirs.

Each lesson dir contains an:

Challenges are designed to be completed iteratively each one expanding on code you've written in previous steps.

**By the end, your efforts will have culminated in a single, workable application!**

Solutions to each lesson can be found under the `solutions` dir.
