# Overview

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the official repo of the **Codecademy Intermediate Go Dev Workshop 2023**!

We assume you are familiar with golang's basic language syntax and data types.

This workshop is built around **6 challenges** designed to be completed over ~2 hours.

The main topics covered:

- Basic HTTP handlers and routing with std lib
- Gin web framework
- Reading and parsing files
- Struct methods and the factory pattern
- Packages and imports
- Interfaces

# Structure

Challenges are chronologically ordered in the numbered dirs.

Each challenge dir contains an:

- `examples.md` to introduce relevant tools / concepts
- `instructions.md` to detail what you should do for the challenge

Challenges are designed to be completed iteratively so that each one you code is built upon what you had created in previous steps.

By the end, your efforts will have culminated in a single, workable application.

Solutions to each challenge can be found under the `solutions` dir.

We recommend you create a new local branch of this repo to write your code.

See challenge #1 to get started!
