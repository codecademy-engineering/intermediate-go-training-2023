# intermediate-go-training-2023

Time: 2 hours

Topics to cover (9):
- modules (basic import of a func from one module into main, examplain the dir structure of app)
- multi-returns (including errors)
- methods on structs, pointers (auto de-referencing)
- Interfaces (possibly in context of tests?)
- Routing And Muxing
- HTTP Handlers
- Embedding And Composition (maybe within context of nested structs for JSON?)
- configs (viper)
- graphql

## Notes
Each numbered step dir could contain:
1. Toy example of the concept for that step
2. Link to a place in a real CC repo with that concept
3. Some instructions to the dev to complete something with that concept
4. Example "checkpointed" code for the project at that stage where someone could copy/paste to get up to speed
5. "Hidden" answer to that step that someone could check

Root of dir is the main.go where each dev is coding the final project.

## Steps in workshop
1. Introduce the project overall
2. Make sure everyone is on certain go version??
3. Clone the repo locally and checkout a new branch
